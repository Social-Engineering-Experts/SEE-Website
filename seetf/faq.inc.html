    <h2>What is a CTF?</h2>
    <p>
        A Capture the Flag (CTF) competition is a cybersecurity competition where teams
        compete to solve a series of challenges. These challenges usually revolve around
        specific topics such as web exploitation, binary exploitation, reverse engineering,
        forensics, cryptography, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal of each challenge is usually to find a hidden piece of text, which is called the flag
        (hence the name of the competition). The flag can be hidden in a file, in a database, 
        in a web page, in a binary, etc.

    <h2>Who are you?</h2>
    <p>
        SEETF is run by Social Engineering Experts, a CTF team based in Singapore.
        We were the ranked 2nd in Singapore on <a href="https://ctftime.org/stats/SG" target="_blank">
            CTFtime
        </a> in 2021, and are on track to retain or advance our rank for 2022.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our members come from various backgrounds in the technology industry, but we're all
        united by our passion for CTF competitions!
    </p>
    <h2>What if I've never done something like this before?</h2>
    <p>
        It can be intimidating, but this is the perfect opportunity to get your feet wet.
        We have challenges that span across various difficulty levels (look out for the beginner-friendly ones!),
        and learning from writeups after the CTF is over is a great way to become a better CTF player.
    </p>
    <h2>Who can participate?</h2>
    <p>
        Anyone who is a living, breathing human being.
    </p>
    <p>
        For Singaporean teams, we have a partnership with
        <a href="https://cyberleague.co" target="_blank">Cyber League</a> that allows you
        to gain points for the Cyber League through participating in SEETF.
        Teams are capped at 3 members, but playing solo or in pairs
        is also a great option if you're here for the fun.
