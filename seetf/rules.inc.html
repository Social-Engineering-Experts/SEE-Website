            Our rules are no different from any other CTF competition. Please note that this list
            is non-exhaustive and any activity that compromises the integrity of the competition
            will result in disqualification.
        </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Do not attack the competition infrastructure. NONE of our challenges require you to
                    run fuzzers, scanners, or bruteforcing tools on our servers, so please do not waste 
                    your time on that.
                </li>
                <hr>
                <li>
                    Strictly no discussion of solutions or hints before the CTF is over.
                </li>
                <hr>
                <li>
                    Strictly no cross-team communication or collaboration before the CTF is over.
                </li>
                <hr>
                <li>
                    Please note that this is NOT a CTF about social engineering! We do not condone 
                    the use of social engineering techniques during the competition.

            At the end of the day, it boils down to exercising common sense and courtesy to your fellow competitors.
            Please do not engage in anything below the "Taboo CTF Tactics" part of the iceberg.
